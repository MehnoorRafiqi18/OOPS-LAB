Q1)/*Keith's Sheet Music needs a program to implement its music teacher's discount policy.The program prompts the user to enter the purchase total and indicate whether the purchaser is a teacher.
Music teachers receive a 10% discount on their sheet music purchases unless the purchase total is $100 or higher. In that case, the discount is 12%. The discount calculation occurs before the addition of the 5% sales tax. Here are two sample outputs one for a teacher and one for a nonteacher. Use necessary manipulators to format your output.
(For Teacher)
Total purchases:$122.00
Teacher's discount (12%): 14.64
Discounted total: 107.36
Sales tax (5%): 5.37
Total:$112.73
(For Non-teacher)
Total purchases:$24.90
Sales tax (5%):1.25
Total: $26.15

Q2)/*
2. Write a program that calculates the user's body mass index (BMI and categorizes it as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese, based on the following table from the United States Centers for Disease Control:
BMI                Weight Status
Below 18.5:        Underweight
18.5-24.9:         Normal
25.0-29.9:         Overweight
30.0 and above:    Obese
To calculate BMI based on weight in pounds (wt_lb) and height in inches (ht_in). use this formula (rounded to tenths):
703 * wt_lb /ht_in
Prompt the user to enter weight in pounds and height in inches.
